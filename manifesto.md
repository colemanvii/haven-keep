# Manifesto

Haven Keep is a discipline before it is a project.

It exists to protect long-term thinking—capital, attention, and values—from short-term noise.

We prefer:
- custody over speculation
- stewardship over optimization
- silence over commentary
- slow truth over fast certainty

If it ever becomes loud, it has failed.

The Keep is measured by one thing:
how calmly we can hold the right decisions over time.
