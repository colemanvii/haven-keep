# Principles

1) Long horizon
We choose decisions that age well.

2) Low noise
We do not feed the commentary machine.

3) Explainability
If we can’t explain it simply, we don’t do it.

4) Restraint
We avoid motion that exists only to feel productive.

5) Custody
We protect what matters more than we chase what’s next.

6) Decision hygiene
Silence first. Then clarity. Then action.
