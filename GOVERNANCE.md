# Governance

## Purpose
Protect long-term thinking—capital, attention, and values—from short-term noise.

## Non-goals
No hype. No urgency. No performance. No optimization-for-its-own-sake.

## Decision rule
If a decision can’t survive 24 hours of silence and a clear explanation to the other partner, we don’t do it.
